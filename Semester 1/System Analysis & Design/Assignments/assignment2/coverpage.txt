According to our research, we found Microsoft Teams to be more of a logical and financial choice than Zoom. Zoom is just a standalone video conferencing app. And additionally, you need to pay C$ 200 for it's "Pro" features which includes video conferencing time limit of upto 30 hours which is limited to upto 40 minutes on its free tier. On top of that it has limited choice of 3rd party app integrations which may hamper your productivity. Also previously, Zoom has found itself in hot water due to its security vulnerabilities and lack of privacy protection features resulting it being deemed unsafe under certain scenarios.
Coming over to Microsoft Teams, the video conferencing time limit is set to 60 minutes but due to the pandemic, the time limit has been increased to 24 hours on free tier. Also, Teams comes tightly integrated with Microsoft's 365 suite which includes Outlook mail, Word, Excel, Sharepoint and it's online cloud storage service Onedrive. On the other hand, if your organisation already has subscription to Microsoft 365 you will have access to all the 'Pro' features which includes 24 hours of video conferencing limit, increased Onedrive storage limit, access to office suite, etc.
