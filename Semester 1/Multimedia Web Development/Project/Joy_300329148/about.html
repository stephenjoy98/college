            <h2>Why should I choose a PC over a Console ? What can it possibly offer ?</h2>

            <div class="hr"></div>

            <p>PCs are awesome machines for gaming, work, and entertainment alike for many reasons. This includes, but is not limited to, the following reasons listed below.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>PC gaming as a whole is much cheaper than console gaming. Especially in the long run, it can be less than half of what a console will cost you. Hidden fees, price hikes, and royalties are abundant for gamers AND developers in the console industry.</li>

              <li>PC hardware offers better bang-for-buck & value than console hardware (same performance for less money, more performance for the same money, or much more performance for a bit more money).</li>

              <li>PCs have the freedom to upgrade whenever YOU decide to, not when Sony or Microsoft decide to. If you just got a big paycheck and wanted to sell your older GPU to a friend for $100 and buy a newer, better one for $300 you could do it tomorrow.</li>

              <li>PCs give you full internal and external control over the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/371ce9/psa_the_graphical_fidelity_triangle/">graphical fidelity</a> triangle. Consoles can control neither.</li>

              <li>PCs easily work with TVs and monitors, and even multiple of each.</li>

              <li>PCs can use nearly every console controller ever made, modern ones (PS3/PS4/X360/XO/XSX) work without even needing a USB adapter.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;and many many more...</p>
